                <p>Hi, I'm Trần Lượng, a passionate student currently working on a web development project. 
                    My main focus is on creating dynamic websites using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend. 
                    I’m also experienced with Microsoft SQL Server for database management.
                
                    While I have a solid foundation in web development, 
                    there are areas where I'm actively working to improve:
                     Time Management: Balancing multiple responsibilities,
                      like school, work, and personal projects, can sometimes 
                      be challenging. I'm learning to prioritize tasks better 
                      and use tools like Trello and Google Calendar to stay 
                      organized. Depth in Backend Development: Although I'm 
                      comfortable with Node.js and Express, I know there's 
                      still more to learn, especially when it comes to optimizing 
                      performance and security. I’m dedicating time to mastering 
                      these aspects. Perfectionism: I tend to focus too much on 
                      small details, which can slow down my progress at times. 
                      I'm learning to find a balance between producing 
                      high-quality work and completing tasks efficiently. 
                      Public Speaking: Presenting my ideas or projects in 
                      front of others can be intimidating. However, I’m 
                      practicing more by engaging in small group discussions
                       and seeking opportunities to improve my communication
                        skills.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <p>On the side, I have experience working in the service industry, 
                    but I'm transitioning out of it to focus more on my technical career and studies. 
                    I enjoy learning new skills, exploring new tools like GitHub for version control, 
                    and refining my coding practices using VSCode.
                    
                    When I'm not coding, 
                    I love engaging in fun activities like organizing minigames and exploring creative projects!

                    Feel free to add or adjust any details to better 
                    reflect who you are! You can also share more about 
                    your hobbies or other areas of interest, 
                    and I can refine the intro further.
                </p>

                <h2 id="abilities">Abilities and Powers</h2>
                <hr>
                <p> I’m quick to learn new technologies, 
                    adaptive in problem-solving, and always eager to improve. 
                    I'm currently honing my skills through a web programming project, 
                    which helps me apply theoretical knowledge into real-world applications.
                    When I'm not coding, I love exploring creative outlets 
                    like organizing fun mini-games and working on team-based projects. 
                    I’m driven by curiosity and a passion for creating innovative solutions!
                </p>
