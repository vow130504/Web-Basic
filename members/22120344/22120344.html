                <p>Hello, I'm Nguyễn Minh Thiện, a dedicated student currently working on a web development project. 
                    My main focus is creating dynamic websites using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while utilizing Node.js and Express on the backend. 
                    I also have experience managing databases with Microsoft SQL Server.
                    
                    While I have a solid foundation in web development, there are several areas where I am striving to grow:
                    Time Management: Juggling school, work, and personal projects can be difficult. I'm improving my ability to prioritize and stay organized by using tools like Trello and Google Calendar.
                    Backend Proficiency: Though I am comfortable working with Node.js and Express, I am eager to deepen my knowledge, especially in optimizing performance and enhancing security. I am dedicating more time to mastering these aspects.
                    Perfectionism: I sometimes get caught up in minor details, which can slow down my progress. I’m learning how to strike a balance between delivering quality work and meeting deadlines efficiently.
                    Public Speaking: Presenting in front of others can be challenging for me, but I’m actively working on improving by participating in group discussions and practicing communication skills.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <p>Beyond my technical projects, I have experience in the service industry, but I’m now shifting focus to my technical career and studies. 
                    I enjoy picking up new skills, exploring tools like GitHub for version control, and refining my coding practices using VSCode.
                    
                    Outside of coding, I love organizing fun activities like minigames and pursuing creative side projects!
                    
                    Feel free to tweak any details to better match who you are! You can also share more about your hobbies or interests, and I can further refine the introduction.
                </p>
            
                <h2 id="abilities">Abilities and Powers</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I am a quick learner, adaptable in solving problems, and always eager to grow. 
                    I’m currently sharpening my skills through a web development project that allows me to apply theory to practical solutions.
                    Outside of programming, I enjoy creative activities like organizing mini-games and collaborating on team projects. 
                    My curiosity and passion for innovation drive me to constantly seek new ways to improve!
                </p>

                <hr>
                <p>Although I have a strong foundation in web development, there are a few areas where I’m actively looking to improve:
                    Time Management: Balancing school, work, and personal projects can be challenging. I’m working on better prioritization and using tools like Trello and Google Calendar to stay on top of tasks.
                    Backend Expertise: While I’m confident with Node.js and Express, I know there’s more to learn, particularly in areas like performance optimization and security. I’m dedicating time to mastering these topics.
                    Perfectionism: I tend to focus too much on small details, which can slow down my progress. I’m learning to balance producing quality work with maintaining efficiency.
                    Public Speaking: Speaking in front of others can be intimidating, but I’m working on building my confidence through group discussions and practice.
