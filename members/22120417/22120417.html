            <h2 id="section1">Characteristics</h2><hr>
            <p>Marky is tactful and is often seen as lazy, often not caring what the other two cockroaches are doing. Although he initially enjoys causing mischief just like the other cockroaches, he becomes more relaxed in later episodes, though he still enjoys hanging out with Joey and Dee Dee and continues to cause general mayhem as he often does. At times, he got tired of Joey's controlling antics and sided with Dee Dee when he felt Joey was too assertive. He is sometimes depicted as clumsy and even dizzy, possibly a symptom of soda addiction as seen in the episode Baby Doll, although he is shown to be talented in many areas, including robbery, play mandolin/ukulele and drawing in the following seasons

                <br><br>He is a hopeless romantic and his hobbies include dating puppets and reading books (although it’s never shown in the series). He also has bad breath, as revealed in the episode It's a Small World and Itsy-Bitsy Oggy (how he can stand his own bad breath is debatable, as he couldn't stand the smell of gas in French Fries.)</p>

            <h2 id="section2">Appearance</h2><hr>
            <p>He is a grey-bodied, green-headed roach with pink eyes. His body is a bit thin and he is almost twice the height of his brothers. He has long, thin, curly antennae, and a big prominent upper lip and he sports white gloves as well as many characters in the show. He moves in a lanky, noodly, and wacky way due to his clumsy and crazy nature.</p>

            <h2 id="section3">Abilities and Powers</h2><hr>
            <p>Lanky body (In French Fries he doesn’t get hurt by Oggy’s old flyswatter because he passes through the holes)

                <br><br>Speed (Despite being often lanky and dizzy, Marky moves around the fastest, examples of this are shown in "Jealousy", in which Oggy doesn't manage to catch up to him in his rampage, and in "Sports Fan", he beats Dee Dee and Joey in a race. It's possibly the reason why he is the one who gets beaten up the least out of all of them, like in "The kitchen boy". One key note though is that in the "Oggy Runner" official mobile game, Joey is faster than him)
                
                <br><br>Seductive voice (In "Jealousy", he is given a satisfying low-pitched voice, however in Season 4 and onwards he is given a very high-pitched voice due to the fact he is given Oggy's sped-up old voice samples but sped up);
                
                <br><br>All-around tool (His companions use his head in many ways, as key to open locks, as seen in "Black and White" and at the beginning of "Oggy Watson" segment of the movie, a plunger in "The cockroaches' awakening", a wrench in "Fragile goods", or as an anvil as seen in "What a dump!")
                
                <br><br>Top-driver skills: In Season 3 he takes control of many vehicles including a forklift, a plane, and Jack's Formula 1 car.
                
                <br><br>Drawing skills: In "The magic pen" he draws a highly detailed menacing dragon. Also, in Season 5, notably in "Marky Da Vinci" and in "Color Conflict", he turns out to be an excellent artist,
                
                <br><br>Next Generation: In Bad hair day, Marky is a very professional hairdresser which makes Piya prefer him to do her hair but Oggy doesn't accept. Like the original series' episode "Baby Doll", he gets foolishly lovestruck over Piya's doll in "The lost doll", to the point where he annoys the other cockroaches. Also, he likes to be a cowboy, but he's not doing this in the American Wild West era.</p>
                <h2 id="section4">Weaknesses</h2><hr>
                <p>Tom-foolery (While not as much as Dee Dee, he sometimes does act clumsily and eventually gets the others hurt unintentionally)</p>
