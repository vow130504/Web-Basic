                    <hr>
                    <p>Hi there! I’m Yuki, and some people see me as a bit lazy because I tend to chill out and not worry too much about what my fellow cockroaches, Joey and Dee Dee, are up to. At first, I loved causing mischief just like they did, but as time went on, I’ve become more laid-back. I still enjoy hanging out with them and stirring up some fun chaos. Sometimes, I get tired of Joey’s bossy ways, and I find myself siding with Dee Dee when Joey gets a little too controlling. I have my clumsy moments, and I might seem a bit dizzy at times—probably a side effect of my soda addiction. However, I have some hidden talents, like being a good thief, playing the mandolin and ukulele, and drawing!
            
                        <br><br>I’m a hopeless romantic, and my hobbies include dating puppets and reading books, although you’ll never see me do that. Oh, and I have pretty bad breath, which is a little embarrassing, but I manage to cope with it!</p>

                    <h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I have a slender build, standing taller than most of my friends. My skin has a warm, light tone that gives me a youthful look. I have straight, dark hair that falls just above my shoulders, framing my face. My almond-shaped eyes are bright and expressive, with a hint of mischief in them. I have a subtle, prominent jawline that adds character to my appearance. I often wear casual, stylish clothing that reflects my playful personality, and I like to accessorize with simple yet unique items. My movements can be a bit clumsy and wacky, which adds to my fun-loving nature.</p>

                    <h2 id="abilities">Abilities and Powers</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>One of my unique traits is my lanky body; I can slip through tight spaces without getting hurt!
            
                        <br><br>I’m surprisingly fast, even though I often feel lanky and dizzy. I can outrun my friends during our playful chases, and I think that’s why I end up getting beaten up the least out of all of us.
                    
                        <br><br>I've got a seductive voice, too! Sometimes, I have a deep voice, but I can also sound high-pitched, depending on the situation.
                    
                        <br><br>I’m quite versatile and often find myself being a helpful friend. My creativity allows me to come up with solutions for various situations, whether it's figuring out how to open tricky locks or using my skills to lend a hand when someone needs it.
                    
                        <br><br>I have top-notch driving skills and can take control of all sorts of vehicles.
                    
                        <br><br>I’m quite the artist! I love to draw and have discovered my talent for it, creating some impressive pieces.
                    
                        <br><br>Additionally, I can be quite the hairstylist, which has gotten me into some interesting situations. I also enjoy playing cowboy, even if it’s just for fun.</p>

                    <h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Like my friend Dee Dee, I can be a bit of a fool sometimes. My clumsiness might unintentionally get my friends into trouble!</p>
